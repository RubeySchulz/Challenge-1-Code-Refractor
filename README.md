# Challenge-1-Code-Refractor
First challenge for bootcamp

Refracted the given code

Short summary of what I changed

- Merged mutltiple CSS statements that were redundant or repetitive.
- Deleted mutiple CSS classes that were redundant or unused
- changed title to something other than "website"
- Changed all the <div> to semantic HTML tags in the right places (Articles, nav, header and footer)
- removed a redundant closing </img> tag
- added a missing ID to one of the main sections
- converted the header and footer from just being a <div> with a class of "header" and "footer" since there is only one of each they dont need a class.
